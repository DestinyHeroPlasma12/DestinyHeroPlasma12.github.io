      <h1>Determination And Perseverance Pushed Me As Far As I Could Go</h1>
      <p>Imagine me for hours, drawing up tons and tons of papers just trying to get closer and closer to perfection. Almost every night for months, almost years on end, I would keep redrawing faces, bodies, poses and pretty much everything under the kitchen sink. I felt like I was getting nowhere, but there I was steadily improving, not even recognizing it.<br>
      This kept going from late elementary, middle to even high school. I kept going and drawing no matter the circumstances.</p>

      <p>"I have kept up my work and I enjoyed doing it. Drawing can be a great way to express creativity and relieve stress. It can also improve hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, and cognitive function. For those who enjoy drawing, it can be a fulfilling and rewarding hobby that allows them to explore their imagination and bring their ideas to life on paper."</p>
      <p>It was very important that I kept up with the perseverance. If you enjoy drawing and want to improve your skills, then perseverance is key. The more you practice, the more you will improve. It's important to remember that everyone starts at different skill levels and progresses at their own pace, so don't get discouraged if you feel like you're not improving as quickly as you'd like. Set achievable goals for yourself, and break them down into smaller steps. Celebrate your progress along the way, and don't be afraid to seek feedback from others. Ultimately, if you love drawing, then it's worth persevering and continuing to develop your skills.</p>
